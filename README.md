# Multi-Module Project in Scala

This is an example of a multi-module project in Scala that demonstrates how to create separate modules for different functionalities, and how to combine them to create a useful tool.

## Modules

The project contains three modules:

1. UserInput - This module provides a way for the user to input values.
2. MathematicalOperations - This module provides a set of math operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. Calculator - This module combines the functionality of UserInput and MathematicalOperations to provide a simple calculator.

## Usage
To use the calculator, simply run the Calculator module. It will prompt you to enter two numbers, and then display the results of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on those numbers.
